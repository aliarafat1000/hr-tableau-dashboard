## ðŸ§© Project Overview

This interactive **Human Resources Dashboard** is a comprehensive data visualization project developed using **Tableau**. It was designed to provide HR departments and decision-makers with a 360-degree view of the workforce, uncover insights into demographics, salary distributions, and employment trends, and help drive informed workforce planning.

The dashboard is split into two major views:

1. **Overview Page** â€“ Aggregate insights on employee demographics, departmental hiring patterns, salary distributions, performance by education level, and more.

3. **Employee Details Page** â€“ A searchable and filterable employee directory with attributes like ID, role, location, salary, hiring status, and length of employment.

This project demonstrates my ability to **translate raw HR data into strategic insights** through dynamic visual storytelling, stakeholder-ready dashboards, and advanced filtering mechanisms.
